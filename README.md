# ABO_Allele_Caller
This repo is the (in progress) data for the ABO allele sequence alignment caller.

## About the Repo
Introduction

This R script is designed to analyze genetic data related to ABO alleles. It performs multiple tasks, including data parsing, sequence processing, simulation of patient genotypes, and calling ABO alleles for simulated patients.

The original ABO alleles are extracted from BD MUT Database of allelic variants of Human Blood Group Antigens (doi: 10.1159/000366108). A now defunct website only accessible via FTP (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/mhc/mhc/Final Archive).
